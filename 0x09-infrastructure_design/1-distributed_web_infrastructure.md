### Infrastructure Elements:

1. **Load Balancer:**
   - **Why:** Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load. This improves performance and redundancy.
   - **Distribution Algorithm:** Common algorithms include Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash. The choice depends on factors like server capacity and traffic patterns.
   - **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:**
      - **Active-Active:** All servers actively handle traffic. It's more efficient but requires careful synchronization of data and state between servers.
      - **Active-Passive:** One server actively handles traffic, and others are on standby. It's simpler but may lead to resource underutilization.

2. **Database Primary-Replica Cluster (Master-Slave):**
   - **How It Works:** The primary node (master) accepts write operations and replicates data to replica nodes (slaves). Read operations can be distributed among replicas. This ensures data redundancy and can improve read performance.
   - **Difference Between Primary and Replica:**
      - **Primary:** Handles write operations and is the authoritative source for data changes.
      - **Replica:** Replicates data from the primary and is used for read operations. It's not authoritative for writes.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - **Load Balancer:** If the load balancer fails, the entire system may become inaccessible. Consider using redundant load balancers or a high-availability setup.
   - **Database Cluster:** If the primary node fails without a proper failover mechanism, write operations may be impacted. Implement automatic failover to a replica.

2. **Security Issues:**
   - **No Firewall:** Lack of a firewall exposes the infrastructure to potential unauthorized access. A firewall helps control incoming and outgoing traffic.
   - **No HTTPS:** Transmitting data without encryption (HTTP) can compromise user data. Implement HTTPS to secure data in transit.

3. **No Monitoring:**
   - **Why Monitoring is Essential:** Without monitoring, it's challenging to detect and address issues promptly. Monitoring tools provide insights into system performance, resource utilization, and potential security threats.
   - **Solution:** Implement monitoring tools to track server health, load balancer performance, database cluster status, and security events. Set up alerts for proactive issue resolution.

Addressing these issues involves implementing redundancy, security measures, and robust monitoring. Regularly updating and patching software components is also crucial for maintaining a secure infrastructure.
