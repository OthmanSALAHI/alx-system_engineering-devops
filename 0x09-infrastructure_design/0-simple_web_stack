### Infrastructure Specifics:

- **Server:**
  A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or functionality to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- **Role of the Domain Name:**
  A domain name serves as a human-readable label for identifying a specific IP address on the internet. It provides a way to access resources, like websites, using easily remembered names instead of numerical IP addresses.

- **Type of DNS Record for www in www.foobar.com:**
  The DNS record for "www" in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which points to the domain's primary record.

- **Role of the Web Server:**
  The web server handles HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and serves web pages or other content in response. It processes incoming requests and sends the appropriate responses.

- **Role of the Application Server:**
  The application server is responsible for executing application logic, processing business rules, and interacting with databases. It works in conjunction with the web server to deliver dynamic content to users.

- **Role of the Database:**
  The database stores and manages data used by the application. It provides a structured way to organize and retrieve information requested by the application or users.

- **Server Communication with User's Computer:**
  The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. The server sends requested data, such as web pages or application responses, to the user's browser.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
  A SPOF is a component within the infrastructure that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail. It represents a vulnerability where the failure of a single element can disrupt the entire service.

- **Downtime During Maintenance:**
  When performing maintenance, such as deploying new code that requires restarting the web server, there can be downtime, leading to a temporary unavailability of the website or services.

- **Scalability Challenges:**
  The infrastructure may face difficulties in handling a large volume of incoming traffic, limiting its ability to scale efficiently. This can result in slower response times or service disruptions during traffic spikes.
