## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Web Server

- **Purpose:** The web server is added to handle incoming HTTP requests and serve web pages or application content.
- **Why it's added:** A web server is essential to host and deliver web applications or static content to users.

### 2. Database Server

- **Purpose:** The database server is included to store and manage data used by the application.
- **Why it's added:** Storing data in a centralized database allows for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and ensures data consistency.

### 3. Load Balancer

- **Purpose:** The load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent overloading of any single server.
- **Why it's added:** Load balancing improves system reliability, scalability, and helps maintain consistent performance during varying levels of traffic.

### 4. Firewall

- **Purpose:** A firewall is implemented to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Why it's added:** Firewalls protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and potential security threats.

### 5. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- **Purpose:** A CDN is added to cache and distribute content across multiple servers located in various geographical locations.
- **Why it's added:** CDNs enhance the performance and speed of content delivery by reducing latency and decreasing the load on the origin server.

### 6. Monitoring Tools

- **Purpose:** Monitoring tools are included to track the health, performance, and availability of the infrastructure components.
- **Why they're added:** Monitoring tools help identify issues proactively, ensure system stability, and enable timely responses to potential problems.

### 7. Backup System

- **Purpose:** A backup system is implemented to regularly back up critical data and configurations.
- **Why it's added:** Backups ensure data recovery in the event of accidental deletion, hardware failures, or other unforeseen incidents.

### 8. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **Purpose:** IAM controls and manages user access to the system, ensuring secure authentication and authorization.
- **Why it's added:** IAM enhances security by restricting access only to authorized individuals and helps prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
